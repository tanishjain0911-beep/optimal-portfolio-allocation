# Optimal Portfolio Allocation using Markowitz Mean–Variance Optimization

This repository contains a structured implementation of the Markowitz Mean–Variance Portfolio Optimization framework using historical stock price data. The project progresses from foundational Python and finance concepts to formulating and solving a convex optimization problem using CVXPY, and finally constructing and visualizing the Efficient Frontier.

The work is organized across three Jupyter notebooks, each corresponding to a specific stage of learning and implementation.
